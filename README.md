# Godone
Command line utility written in Go for quickly setting up and running C/C++ projects.

Start by reading `main.go` and then move on to `libgodone/godone.go`.
Also this utility is meant for Linux/MacOS/BSD users. Enjoy!

**NOTE:** There *might* be bugs (which I'm certain there are) so please let me know when you do find one!
